    "Now lets try to understand what is happening. The loop, also known as for loop, starts with a 'for'. The next parts - 'for sales in sales_w1:' , this part basically tells python to take the sales_w1 list, and take one item at a time from the sales_w1, and store it in the variable sales, which is a temporary variable created for this situation. So first value sales has is the first value in sales_w1 list. The way loop is being run is that, it starts with the first value of sales_w1, and stores it as sales, then executes the next line of the command - 'inflated_sales.append(sales * 1.1)'. This command tells python to take the sales value (which is now the first value of sales_w1) and then multiply by 1.1, and then store in as a value in the list 'inflated_sales'. Then we go back to the for loop again, and this time, after taking the first value from salews_w1, python will take the second value, then store it in sales, and then add 'sales * 1.1' as another value in the 'inflated_sales' and so on!"
