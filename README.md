# Basic-Intro-to-Analytics-and-ML-with-Python
For those who have no previous coding background, and just starting to venture into Pyhton for analytics and some machine learning, this repository tells you how to get started. But this is by no means a complete guide

These are all jupyter noteboks, and all based on the the datafile uploaded in the repositories data folder

Feel free to open the Jupyter notebooks by any software you want to run python with. But for begineers, I strongly recommend you download and install Anaconda from - https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Reason for using Anaconda - makes it easy to open and load jupyter notebooks, provides the basic packages and codes needed to quickly start coding, and is hassle free in setting up

If you need help with downloading these jupyter notebooks and running them in your computer's Jupyter environment, I have added a help file explaining how to do so
