# Basic-Intro-to-Analytics-and-ML-with-Python
For those who have no previous coding background, and just starting to venture into Pyhton for analytics and some machine learning, this repository tells you how to get started. But this is by no means a complete guide

These are all jupyter noteboks, and all based on the the datafile uploaded in the repositories data folder

Feel free to open the Jupyter notebooks by any software you want to run python with. But for begineers, I strongly recommend you download and install Anaconda from - https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution

Reason for using Anaconda - makes it easy to open and load jupyter notebooks, provides the basic packages and codes needed to quickly start coding, and is hassle free in setting up

If you need help with downloading these jupyter notebooks and running them in your computer's Jupyter environment, I have added a help file explaining how to do so

Few Advice:
1. For each of the notebooks, go to Kernel option and then click Restart and Clear all Output
2. Then check the instructions and then for each of the code lines, run them by pressing Shift + Enter (Return on Mac)
3. After you are done with each notebook, try to repeat and recreate the same set of codes in another new notebook, which you create. No need to write the instructions, just try running the codes. If you are stuck - GOOGLE!
4. Try running the same codes in different data, different columns in DM, and try and get more insights

This is not all, you will be starting a long journey to be familiar running Python and carrying out Analytics and ML. Best of Luck
